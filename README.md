# CSV Viewer

### Repo contains the solution to a problem statement given by AffinityAnswers

### Problem Statement:

I have a bunch of files in CSV format (wth same set of fields) and to aid non-programmers I need to make it easy to access the same. Develop a web UI which has a dropdown to select one file and one or more fields in the file and extract the information? Write both the front-end code and back-end code.
